Issues:

make sure to install R and the packages in install.r

1)
For users of MacOS Mojave, there will be issues with the compilation of the pcalg R package required to run the causal module. How to solve them

Install the V8 using brew: http://macappstore.org/v8/
install v8 in R: install.packages('v8')

also install 'pcalg', kpcalg, RCIT 



2)
There are issues with the detection of R script. In order to solve them we need to do the following:
Find R's location using R.home()
Add the R home location as RSCRIPT_PATH environment variable by appending the following to your ~./bashrc, or ~/.zshrc file (depends on the terminal you are using) and then restart it:
export RSCRIPT_PATH="REPLACE WITH YOUR R.home() location"

3)
There was an issue of DoWhy asking whether you want to continue with confounders. The old solution was to replace the file causal_identifier.py in site-packages/dowhy with the causal_identifier.py in installation notes. I don't think this is happening any more.
